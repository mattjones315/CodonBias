# Codon Bias 
These files are the framework for analyzing bias in synonymous mutations in the human genome. The files are broken up into simulations (for theoretical work) and scripts (for analyzing real data). Most of the data was obtained from the ExAC and gnomAD databases,generously provided by the MacArthur lab.
